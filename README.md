# How does Kokkos manage CUDA streams?
I ran `HPXandKokkosHPX_vs_KokkosOpenMP.cpp` with a Serial Host backend and Cuda device backend. HPX schedules 10 tasks one after another, each on is a function which calls a device kernel. Using `nsys`, it seems they are all using the **same** stream whicih is not the default stream - two streams in total. Events view of the default stream mostly shows `memcpy` calls.
